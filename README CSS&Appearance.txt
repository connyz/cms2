Changing appearance of the Amazing Blog ==============================================

The files which determines the appearance of the site are 3 css files located
in the "css" folder and and one js-file located in the "libs" folder.

We are using bootstrap for quicker prototyping of the site and the files which
belongs to the bootstrap framework is the "bootstrap.js" file and the "bootstrap.css"
file. Do not tamper with the js file!

If there specific css changes you want to make please either change them in the
"style.css" file which in turn will overwrite "bootstrap.css" or change them
directly in "bootstrap.css". Custom css not belonging to bootstrap should be
written in the "style.css" file.

To keep the styles coherent across different browsers we have also included the
"meyerReset.css" which is loaded first of all css.
